# How To Adult
Welcome to our How To Adult Site, a website designed by a bunch of people who are trying to adult, and want to help other pseudoadults adult too! <br />

Each page helps to break down complicated Adulting topics in 5 easy steps. And for those who don't want to read, each 5 step how-to is followed by a handy dandy video. <br />

This was developed for IT-280B at St.Bonaventure University. <br />

## React Router 
This app uses react router, a collection of navigational components that compose declaritively within the website. <br />

Instal react router using 
```npm install react-router-dom```

## Other Cool Features 
This website was styled using [w3-css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) 
<br/>
A page template was created so that new pages can be created in the PageList.js and automatically added to the website. These pages would then automatically be accessable via the search bar and side bar using our search function and react router. 
<br/>
The home screen also has a random quote generator that changes each time a user reloads the page.
